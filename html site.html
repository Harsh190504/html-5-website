 <div><p> HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide.<br>
            It is the fifth and final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.<br>
            The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application <br>
            Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft</p>
            <p>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"<br>
                status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and <br>
                other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers<br>
                and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with <br>
                older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]
        <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves,<br>
            and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces <br>
            (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile<br>
            applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
        <p>Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, <br>
            the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements were added, expandable sections are natively implemented through <br>
                <summary>...</summary> and <details>...</details> rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript, and support for<br>
                scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the<br>
                semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as <main>, <section>, <article>, <header>,<br>
                    <footer>, <aside>, <nav>, and <figure> are added. New attributes were introduced, some elements and<br>
                        attributes were removed, and others such as <a>, <cite>, and <menu> were changed, redefined, or <br>
                            standardized. The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5<br>
                            specification,[7] and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[8]
        <h1>History</h1>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/HTML5_APIs_and_related_technologies_taxonomy_and_status.svg/630px-HTML5_APIs_and_related_technologies_taxonomy_and_status.svg.png"
        <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004.<br>,
            At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[9] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was <br>
            focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter<br>
            to expire and decided not to renew it.[10]
        </p>
        <p>The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <br>
                workshop in June 2004,[11] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing<br>
                browsers,[12] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a <br>
                vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML.[13] Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed<br>
                to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.[14]<br>
                The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5.[15] The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting<br>
                    point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.
        </p>
                    <p>WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of the specification <br>
                        on 22 January 2008.[2]

                        <h1>"Thoughts on Flash"</h1>
                        <p>While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very <br>
                            different. Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using Scalable<br>
                            Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity – it must be <br>
                            supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart<br>
                            in HTML5 (see Comparison of HTML5 and Flash). HTML5's interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream<br>
                            media attention around April 2010[16][17][18][19] after Apple Inc.'s then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public<br>
                                letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" in which he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary to watch video <br>
                                or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5,<br>
                                will win".[20] This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5 provides <br>
                                enhanced functionality, developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the<br>
                                standard as well as other functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash.[21] In early November 2011,<br.
                                Adobe announced that it would discontinue the development of Flash for mobile devices <br>
                                    and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5.[22] On 25 July 2017, <br>
                                    Adobe announced that both the distribution and support of Flash would cease by the <br>
                                    end of 2020.[23] Adobe itself officially discontinued Flash on 31 December 2020 and<br>
                                    all Flash content was blocked from running in Flash Player as of 12 January 2021.[24]

            <h1>Features and APIs
                <hr>
                <p>The W3C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress,<br>
                    meaning identifying specific features, either proposed or already existing in the spec, and advancing<br>
                    them as separate specifications. Some technologies that were originally defined in HTML5 itself are now<br>
                    defined in separate specifications:
                </p>
                <p>HTML Working Group — HTML Canvas 2D Context;
                  <p>Immersive Web Working Group — WebXR Device API, WebXR Gamepads Module, WebXR Augmented Reality Module, and others;[89]
                   <p>Web Apps Working Group — Web Messaging, Web workers, Web storage, WebSocket, Server-sent events, Web Components[90]<br>
                    (this was not part of HTML5, though); the Web Applications Working Group was closed in October 2015 and its deliverables<br>
                    transferred to the Web Platform Working Group (WPWG)
                   </p>
                   <p>ETF HyBi Working Group — WebSocket Protocol;

                   </p>
                <p>WebRTC Working Group — WebRTC;
                 <p>Web Media Text Tracks Community Group — WebVTT.
                  <p>Some features that were removed from the original HTML5 specification have been standardized separately as modules,<br>
                    such as Microdata and Canvas. Technical specifications introduced as HTML5 extensions such as Polyglot markup have<br>
                    also been standardized as modules. Some W3C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been <br>
                    adapted as HTML5 extensions or features, such as SVG. Some features that might have slowed down the standardization<br>
                    of HTML5 were or will be standardized as upcoming specifications, instead.
